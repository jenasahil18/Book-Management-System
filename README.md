# Book-Management-System
**Book Management System** is an SQL-based project designed to manage and organize book data, including titles, authors, genres, and inventory. It supports efficient querying, user management, and transaction tracking. Ideal for libraries, bookstores, or personal collections, this system streamlines book management with easy-to-use SQL operations.

### Key Features:

1. **Comprehensive Book Cataloging**:
   - The Book Management System allows users to catalog books with detailed attributes, including titles, authors, genres, ISBNs, publishers, and publication dates. 
   - The system supports multiple authors per book and categorizes books by genre, making it easy to organize and retrieve specific titles from the database.

2. **User Management**:
   - The system includes a user management feature that tracks users who borrow books. It maintains a record of each userâ€™s borrowing history, contact information, and account status.
   - This feature is especially useful for libraries and institutions where multiple users interact with the book collection.

3. **Inventory Management**:
   - Keep track of the inventory with features that monitor stock levels, issue alerts for low stock, and manage book reorders.
   - The system supports transaction logs, allowing you to track when books are added or removed from the inventory, ensuring accurate record-keeping.

4. **Loan and Return Tracking**:
   - For libraries, the system includes a module for tracking book loans and returns. It logs who borrowed which book, the due date for return, and whether the book has been returned or is overdue.
   - This helps in managing circulation efficiently and ensuring that books are returned on time.

5. **Advanced Search and Querying**:
   - The system provides powerful search and querying capabilities. Users can search for books by title, author, genre, or ISBN, and filter results based on availability, publication year, or other criteria.
   - SQL queries can be customized for more advanced data retrieval and analysis, making it easy to generate reports and insights on the book collection.
